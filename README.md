## 📦 Included Projects

Each project lives in its own folder with:

✔️ Source code (`.ino`)  
✔️ Circuit diagrams (breadboard / schematics)  
✔️ Project description  
✔️ Parts list  

Examples include (adjust based on your actual content):

- **Blink (LED Basic)** – Blink built‑in LED
- **Traffic Light System** – Simulate traffic lights with LEDs
- **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor** – HC‑SR04 distance measurement
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitor** – Using DHT11/DHT22
- **Servo Motor Control** – Controlling servos with potentiometer
- **LCD Display UI** – Output text to a 16×2 LCD
